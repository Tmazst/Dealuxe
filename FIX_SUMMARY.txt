========================================
ASSERTION ERROR FIX - Phase Mismatch
========================================
UPDATED: Fixed ALL UnicodeEncodeError issues

FILES THAT NEED TO BE UPLOADED TO VPS:
---------------------------------------
1. game/engine.py - Fixed unicode in logs, added safe_print
2. controllers/flask_controller.py - Request validation
3. controllers/ai_controller.py - Fixed card printing
4. static/js/game.js - Request locking
5. app.py - Already fixed player_details print

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
-------------------
Even with 1 Gunicorn worker, the AssertionError "assert self.state.phase == 'ATTACK'" 
was occurring due to:

1. RACE CONDITION: User could click attack multiple times rapidly
2. STALE STATE: Frontend's currentState was outdated during animations (450ms delay)
3. MISSING VALIDATION: Backend continued processing even when actions failed
4. UNICODE ENCODING: VPS uses latin-1 encoding, couldn't handle → ✔ ❌ characters

SCENARIO THAT CAUSED THE ERROR:
--------------------------------
1. User attacks with card → Phase changes to DEFENSE
2. AI defends successfully → Phase changes to ATTACK, roles swap
3. AI immediately attacks → Phase changes to DEFENSE again
4. Meanwhile, user's second click arrives (before state refresh)
5. Backend receives attack request while phase = DEFENSE
6. AssertionError thrown ❌

ROOT CAUSES:
------------
✗ No request locking in frontend - allowed concurrent/duplicate requests
✗ Delayed state refresh (450ms) left currentState stale
✗ Backend ran AI even when actions failed
✗ No proper error handling - assertions crashed the server
✗ Unicode characters throughout codebase (→ ✔ ❌ ♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) caused encoding errors on VPS

UNICODE ISSUES FIXED:
---------------------
1. game/engine.py:
   - Replaced → with -> in phase transitions
   - Replaced ✔ ❌ with plain text
   - Changed _log() to print card.value instead of card object
   - Added safe_print() helper for all console output
   
2. controllers/ai_controller.py:
   - print(f"Attacks with {card}") → print(f"Attacks with card value {card.value}")
   - print(f"Defends with {c1} + {c2}") → print(f"Defends with {c1.value} + {c2.value}")
   
3. app.py:
   - Removed card data from player_details print statement

FIXES APPLIED:
--------------

1. FRONTEND (static/js/game.js):
   ✓ Added isRequestInProgress flag to prevent concurrent requests
   ✓ Added try-catch error handling
   ✓ Display error messages to user when actions fail
   ✓ Only release lock after state refresh completes

2. BACKEND (controllers/flask_controller.py):
   ✓ Check if action succeeded before running AI
   ✓ Added detailed logging for phase transitions
   ✓ Return errors instead of continuing on failure

3. ENGINE (game/engine.py):
   ✓ Better error messages with current phase info
   ✓ Log all phase transitions for debugging
   ✓ Return error dicts instead of using assertions (already done)
   ✓ Replaced unicode characters (→ ✔ ❌) with ASCII (-> OK, Failed)

WHAT TO MONITOR:
----------------
Watch your server logs for these messages:
- "[ENGINE] Phase transition: X → Y" - Shows state changes
- "[FLASK_CTRL] Attack/Defend request - Phase: ..." - Request tracking
- "[FLASK_CTRL] Attack failed: ..." - Error detection
- "[FRONTEND] Request already in progress" - Duplicate prevention

TESTING:
--------
1. Try rapid-clicking attack cards
2. Check that only one request processes at a time
3. Verify error messages display when phase is wrong
4. Confirm no more AssertionErrors in logs

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------
1. Upload updated files to VPS:
   - static/js/game.js
   - controllers/flask_controller.py
   - game/engine.py

2. Restart Gunicorn:
   sudo systemctl restart gunicorn

3. Monitor logs:
   sudo journalctl -u gunicorn -f

The fix ensures graceful error handling and prevents race conditions,
even with a single worker process.
